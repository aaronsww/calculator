# Calculator

<a href="https://aaronsww.github.io/calculator">Live Demonstration.</a>

## Project Summary

In this project, I made an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I learned how to store and manage data amidst an active UI implementing my own logic. This calculator contains functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators.

### Functionality:

<ul>
    <li>Divide, multiply, add, subtract and reminder operations.</li>
    <li>"AC" button that erases all of the data inputted into the calculator.</li>
    <li>"C" button that erases the last input.</li>
    <li>Decimal "." button that only allows the user to input 1 decimal point.</li>
</ul>
